# Transfer Matrix as L² Operator

Formalizes the transfer matrix as a bounded linear operator on L²(ℝ^Ns)
and connects it to the spectral theorem for compact self-adjoint operators.

## Main definitions

- `L2SpatialField Ns` — The Hilbert space L²(ℝ^Ns) where the transfer operator acts
- `transferOperatorCLM` — The transfer matrix as a CLM on L², defined via the
  kernel factorization T = M_w ∘ Conv_G ∘ M_w
- `transferOperator_spectral` — Spectral decomposition from gaussian-field's
  `compact_selfAdjoint_spectral`

## Construction

The transfer kernel factors as:
  `T(ψ, ψ') = w(ψ) · G(ψ - ψ') · w(ψ')`
where:
- `w(ψ) = exp(-(a/2) · h(ψ))` is the weight (bounded, from spatial action)
- `G(x) = exp(-timeCoupling(0, x))` is the Gaussian kernel (in L¹)

This gives `T = M_w ∘ Conv_G ∘ M_w` where:
- `M_w` is multiplication by `w` (a CLM on L² by Hölder, from L2Multiplication.lean)
- `Conv_G` is convolution with `G` (a CLM on L² by Young, from L2Convolution.lean)

The transfer operator acts on L²(ℝ^Ns, dx) where ℝ^Ns = SpatialField Ns
and dx is Lebesgue measure (product of 1D Lebesgue measures). -/

The building blocks for the kernel factorization T = M_w ∘ Conv_G ∘ M_w. -/

/-- The weight function `w(ψ) = exp(-(a/2) · h(ψ))` where `h` is the spatial action.

This is bounded above by `exp(a · Ns · A / 2)` where `A` is the lower bound
constant from `wickPolynomial_bounded_below`, since:
- `spatialKinetic ≥ 0` (sum of squares)
- `spatialPotential ≥ -Ns · A` (from Wick polynomial bound below)
- Therefore `h(ψ) ≥ -Ns · A`, so `w(ψ) ≤ exp(a · Ns · A / 2)`. -/

/-! ## Transfer operator definition

The transfer operator is defined as `T = M_w ∘ Conv_G ∘ M_w`, where
`M_w` is multiplication by the weight and `Conv_G` is Gaussian convolution.

This replaces the previous axiom `transferOperatorCLM` with a definition,
eliminating one axiom from the proof. -/

/-- The transfer matrix as a continuous linear map on L²(ℝ^Ns).

Defined via the kernel factorization:
  `T = M_w ∘ Conv_G ∘ M_w`
where `w(ψ) = exp(-(a/2)·h(ψ))` and `G(x) = exp(-½‖x‖²)`.

This factors the transfer kernel as:
  `T(ψ,ψ') = w(ψ) · G(ψ-ψ') · w(ψ')`
           `= exp(-(a/2)h(ψ)) · exp(-½‖ψ-ψ'‖²) · exp(-(a/2)h(ψ'))`
           `= exp(-timeCoupling(ψ,ψ') - (a/2)h(ψ) - (a/2)h(ψ'))` -/

/-! ## Properties of the transfer operator -/

/-- The transfer operator is self-adjoint on L²(ℝ^Ns).

This follows from the factorization `T = M_w ∘ Conv_G ∘ M_w` and the
self-adjointness of each factor:
- `M_w` is self-adjoint (since `w` is real-valued)
- `Conv_G` is self-adjoint (since the Gaussian is symmetric: `G(x) = G(-x)`)

Then: `⟨f, Tg⟩ = ⟨f, M_w(Conv_G(M_w g))⟩`
    `= ⟨M_w f, Conv_G(M_w g)⟩`     (M_w self-adjoint)
    `= ⟨Conv_G(M_w f), M_w g⟩`     (Conv_G self-adjoint)
    `= ⟨M_w(Conv_G(M_w f)), g⟩`    (M_w self-adjoint)
    `= ⟨Tf, g⟩`.

**Proof strategy**: Prove self-adjointness of `mulCLM` (from real-valuedness
of `w` and the L² inner product) and of `convCLM` (from symmetry of the
Gaussian kernel), then compose. -/

/-- The transfer operator is compact on L²(ℝ^Ns).

The naive translation-invariant bound
`∫∫ exp(-‖ψ-ψ'‖²) dψ dψ' < ∞` is false on `ℝ^Ns × ℝ^Ns` (it diverges).
Compactness comes from *both* Gaussian factors:

- `G(ψ-ψ') ≤ 1`
- `w(ψ)` decays Gaussianly in `ψ` (from `transferWeight_gaussian_decay`)

For the kernel `K(ψ,ψ') = w(ψ) G(ψ-ψ') w(ψ')`, this gives
`|K(ψ,ψ')|² ≤ w(ψ)² w(ψ')²`, so if `w ∈ L²`, then
`K ∈ L²(ℝ^Ns × ℝ^Ns)` and the operator is Hilbert-Schmidt, hence compact.

In this file we keep compactness axiomatic, since the required theorem
"L²-kernel integral operator ⇒ compact CLM on L²" is not yet wired here. -/

By `compact_selfAdjoint_spectral`, there exists:

/-! ## Perron-Frobenius facts on spectral data

The Perron-Frobenius properties (eigenvalue positivity, ground-state simplicity,
spectral gap) are derived from Jentzsch's theorem in `Jentzsch.lean`.
The names `transferOperator_eigenvalues_pos`, `transferOperator_ground_simple`,
`transferOperator_inner_nonneg`, and `transferOperator_ground_simple_spectral`
are defined there with the same signatures as the former axioms here. -/
