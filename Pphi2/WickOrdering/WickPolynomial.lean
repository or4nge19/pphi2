# Wick-Ordered Polynomials on the Lattice

Defines Wick ordering of polynomials with respect to a Gaussian measure with
covariance parameter `c`. Wick ordering subtracts self-contractions, making
`:φ^n:` orthogonal to lower Wick monomials in L²(μ_GFF).

## Main definitions

- `wickMonomial n c x` — the Wick-ordered monomial `:x^n:_c`
- `wickPolynomial P c x` — Wick-ordered interaction polynomial

## Mathematical background

The Wick-ordered monomial `:x^n:_c` with respect to a Gaussian of variance c
is the probabilist's Hermite polynomial scaled by c:

  `:x^n:_c = c^{n/2} · He_n(x / √c)`

where He_n is the probabilist's Hermite polynomial (Mathlib's `Polynomial.hermite`).

Equivalently, via the recursion:
  `:x^0:   = 1`
  `:x^1:   = x`
  `:x^{n+1}: = x · :x^n: - n·c · :x^{n-1}:`

The key property: `E_μ[:x^n:] = 0` for n ≥ 1 when μ = N(0, c).

/-- The Wick-ordered monomial `:x^n:_c` with variance parameter `c`.

Defined via the recursion:
  `:x^0: = 1`, `:x^1: = x`, `:x^{n+2}: = x · :x^{n+1}: - (n+1)·c · :x^n:`

This equals `c^{n/2} · He_n(x/√c)` where He_n is the probabilist's Hermite
polynomial, but the recursive definition avoids division by zero when c = 0
and is more convenient for computation. -/

/-! ## Connection to Hermite polynomials

When c > 0, the Wick monomial equals the scaled Hermite polynomial:
  `:x^n:_c = c^{n/2} · He_n(x / √c)`

Proved via `wick_eq_hermiteR_rpow` from gaussian-field's HermiteWick module,
which establishes this by induction using the Hermite three-term recurrence.
The bridge lemma `wickMonomial_eq_root` shows that `Pphi2.wickMonomial`
agrees with the root-level `wickMonomial` from gaussian-field. -/

/-! ## Wick-ordered interaction polynomial -/

/-- The Wick-ordered interaction polynomial `:P(x):_c`.

Given `P(τ) = (1/n)τⁿ + Σ_{m<n} a_m τᵐ`, the Wick-ordered version replaces
each monomial τᵐ with `:τ^m:_c`:

  `:P(x):_c = (1/n) · :x^n:_c + Σ_{m<n} a_m · :x^m:_c`

This subtracts the self-contraction divergences. -/

/-! ## Bounded below: the main result

Strategy: The wickPolynomial is a polynomial function of x with even degree ≥ 4
and positive leading coefficient 1/n. For large |x|, the leading term dominates.
On bounded intervals, continuity gives a finite minimum. -/

/-- A polynomial with even degree ≥ 2 and positive leading coefficient
is bounded below.

Proof: Combine ‖p.eval‖ → ∞ (from `tendsto_norm_atTop`) with
"eventually nonneg" (even degree + positive leading coeff) to get
p.eval → +∞ on cocompact, then `Continuous.exists_forall_le` gives
the global minimum. -/

/-! ## Uniform bounded below -/

/-- The Wick polynomial is uniformly bounded below for c in a bounded interval.

For large |x|, the leading term (1/n)x^n dominates regardless of c (the
sub-leading coefficients are bounded on [0,C] by coefficient continuity).
On the compact remainder [0,C] × [-R,R], joint continuity gives a finite
minimum. -/
