# Hypercontractivity Bound on the Rough Error

Applies hypercontractivity to the rough (high-frequency) part of the
interaction after covariance splitting, obtaining a stretched-exponential
tail bound.

## Main results

- `rough_error_variance` — `E[E_R²] ≤ C · T^δ` (small when T small)
- `rough_error_Lp_bound` — `‖E_R‖_p ≤ C · p² · T^{δ/2}`
- `rough_error_tail_bound` — `P(|E_R| > λ) ≤ exp(-c · λ^{1/2} / T^{δ/4})`

## Mathematical content

After splitting φ = φ_S + φ_R:
- The rough error E_R contains all cross-terms from the Wick binomial
- E_R is a degree-4 polynomial in the rough field φ_R
- By hypercontractivity: ‖E_R‖_p ≤ (p-1)² · ‖E_R‖_2
- The L² norm ‖E_R‖_2 is controlled by C_R(x,y)⁴ (from roughCovariance_sq_summable)
- Optimizing p in Chebyshev gives the stretched-exponential tail

/-! ## L² bound on the rough error

The rough error E_R = V - V_S contains all terms from the Wick binomial
expansion that involve at least one power of φ_R. For φ⁴ theory:

E_R = a² Σ_x [4:φ_S³:·φ_R + 6:φ_S²:·:φ_R²: + 4φ_S·:φ_R³: + :φ_R⁴:]

The L² norm of E_R under the GFF measure involves sums of products of
covariance matrix entries. The key bound: because every term has at least
one C_R factor, the variance is controlled by ‖C_R‖² which is O(T^δ). -/

/-- **Variance of the rough error**: the L² norm of the rough error
(the cross-terms from the Wick binomial expansion) is controlled by
the L² norm of the rough covariance.

For d = 2: E[E_R²] ≤ C · T^{1/2}

This is the key estimate that makes the rough error "small" when T is small. -/

/-! ## Hypercontractivity on the rough error

The rough error E_R is a polynomial of degree ≤ 4 in the Gaussian field.
By hypercontractivity (Nelson's inequality):

  ‖E_R‖_p ≤ (p-1)^{4/2} · ‖E_R‖_2 = (p-1)² · ‖E_R‖_2

Since ‖E_R‖_2 ≤ C · T^{1/4} (from rough_error_variance), we get:

  ‖E_R‖_p ≤ C · p² · T^{1/4}  -/

For the rough error E_R (degree 4 polynomial of Gaussian field):

where δ > 0 comes from roughCovariance_sq_summable. -/

/-! ## Tail bound via Chebyshev optimization

From the L^p bound ‖E_R‖_p ≤ C · p² · T^{1/4}, Chebyshev gives:

  P(|E_R| > λ) ≤ (‖E_R‖_p / λ)^p ≤ (C · p² · T^{1/4} / λ)^p

Optimize over p: set p = (λ / (eC · T^{1/4}))^{1/2}, getting:

  P(|E_R| > λ) ≤ exp(-c · λ^{1/2} / T^{1/8})

This is the stretched-exponential tail bound needed for Nelson's trick. -/

/-- **Stretched-exponential tail bound for the rough error.**

  P(|E_R| > λ) ≤ exp(-c · λ^{1/2} · T^{-1/8})

The exponent 1/2 comes from degree 4 (general: 2/degree).
The T^{-1/8} factor makes the tail sharper as T → 0. -/
