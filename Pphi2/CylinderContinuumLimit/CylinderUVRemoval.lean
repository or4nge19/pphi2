# Cylinder UV Removal: Λ → ∞

Removes the UV cutoff Λ from the cylinder interacting measure,
constructing the UV limit measure μ_T for each fixed temporal extent T.

## Main results

- `cylinderUVLimitMeasure` — the limit measure as Λ → ∞
- `cylinderUVLimitMeasure_isProbability` — it is a probability measure
- `cylinderUVLimit_weakLimit` — it is the weak limit of μ_{Λ,T}

## Mathematical background

The UV limit exists because Wick ordering removes the logarithmic
divergence of the bare interaction. Concretely:

1. V_{Λ,T} converges in L²(μ_free) as Λ → ∞ because the Wick-ordered
   integrand :P(φ_Λ):_{c_Λ} has controlled differences: the variance
   of V_{Λ',T} - V_{Λ,T} involves only spatial modes |k| ∈ (Λ, Λ'],
   which are independent under μ_free and whose Wick-ordered contribution
   vanishes by the renormalization cancellation.

2. L² convergence of V implies L¹ convergence of exp(-V) (by dominated
   convergence + uniform lower bound), hence weak convergence of measures.

This is the cylinder analogue of the lattice continuum limit (a → 0),
but simpler: the UV cutoff Λ is a Fourier mode truncation, not a
lattice spacing, so no embedding map is needed.

/-- **Integrability of (ω f)^2 under the cutoff interacting measure.**

Since the interacting measure μ_{Λ,T} = (1/Z)·exp(-V)·dμ_free has density bounded
by exp(B)/Z ≤ exp(B) w.r.t. the free Gaussian measure (where V ≥ -B), and (ω f)^2 is
integrable under μ_free (by Gaussian all-moments / pairing_memLp at p = 2), the function
(ω f)^2 is also integrable under μ_{Λ,T}.

This is used in the truncation argument for `cylinderUVLimit_second_moment_finite`. -/

/-! ## UV limit measure

The UV limit measure μ_T is the weak limit of the cutoff measures μ_{Λ,T}
as Λ → ∞. Its existence follows from:
- Uniform second moment bounds (from `cylinderInteracting_second_moment_bound`)
- Tightness via Mitoma criterion (nuclear test function space)
- Prokhorov's theorem on the Polish configuration space -/

/-- **UV limit measure** on the cylinder for fixed temporal extent T.

This is the P(φ)₂ interacting measure with UV cutoff removed:
  `μ_T = lim_{Λ→ ∞} (1/Z_{Λ,T}) exp(-V_{Λ,T}) dμ_free`

The limit exists because:
1. Uniform moment bounds (from hypercontractivity + density transfer)
   give tightness of {μ_{Λ,T}}_Λ
2. Prokhorov on the Polish configuration space extracts a convergent
   subsequence
3. The limit is independent of subsequence (by L² convergence of V_{Λ,T}) -/

/-- **Finite second moments** under the UV limit measure.

The proof uses weak convergence + truncation + monotone convergence:
1. For each M > 0, let g_M(ω) = min((ω f)², M). This is bounded and continuous.
2. By `cylinderUVLimit_weakLimit`: ∫ g_M dμ_T = lim_Λ ∫ g_M dμ_{Λ,T}
3. Since g_M ≤ (ω f)², we have ∫ g_M dμ_{Λ,T} ≤ ∫ (ω f)² dμ_{Λ,T} ≤ C
   by `cylinderInteracting_second_moment_bound`
4. Therefore ∫ g_M dμ_T ≤ C for all M
5. By monotone convergence (g_M ↑ (ω f)²), we get ∫ (ω f)² dμ_T ≤ C
