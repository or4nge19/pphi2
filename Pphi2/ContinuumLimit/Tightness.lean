# Tightness of the Continuum-Embedded Measures

Shows that the family of continuum-embedded measures `{ν_a}_{a>0}` is tight
in S'(ℝ²). This is the key technical step enabling extraction of a
convergent subsequence via Prokhorov's theorem.

## Main results

- `second_moment_uniform` — uniform bound on `∫ |Φ_a(f)|² dν_a`
- `moment_equicontinuity` — equicontinuity of moments in f
- `continuumMeasures_tight` — tightness of {ν_a} in S'(ℝ²)

## Mathematical background

### Tightness criterion (Mitoma)

A family of probability measures {ν_α} on S'(ℝ^d) is tight iff for each
f ∈ S(ℝ^d), the real-valued random variables {Φ_α(f)} are tight on ℝ.

By Chebyshev, tightness of {Φ_α(f)} on ℝ follows from uniform second
moment bounds: `sup_α ∫ |Φ_α(f)|² dν_α < ∞`.

### Uniform moment bounds

The key input is Nelson's hypercontractive estimate, which gives:

  `∫ |Φ_a(f)|² dμ_a ≤ C · ‖f‖²_{H^{-1}}`

uniformly in a, where `‖f‖_{H^{-1}}` is the Sobolev H^{-1} norm.

For the interacting measure, the bound follows from:
1. The Gaussian two-point function: `∫ Φ_a(f)² dμ_{GFF} = ⟨f, G_a f⟩`
2. The interaction only improves decay: `∫ Φ_a(f)² dμ_a ≤ e^C · ∫ Φ_a(f)² dμ_{GFF}`
3. The lattice propagator converges: `⟨f, G_a f⟩ → ⟨f, G f⟩`

/-! ## Uniform second moment bounds -/

/-- **Uniform bound on the second moment of field evaluations.**

  `∫ |Φ_a(f)|² dν_a ≤ C(f)` uniformly in a

where `Φ_a(f) = (ι_a φ)(f) = a^d Σ_x φ(x) f(ax)` is the continuum field
evaluation.

The bound C(f) depends on the Schwartz function f but not on the
lattice spacing a. It is controlled by the H^{-1} Sobolev norm of f.

Proof outline:
1. `∫ Φ_a(f)² dμ_a ≤ e^{C|Λ|} · ∫ Φ_a(f)² dμ_{GFF}` (interaction bounded below)
2. `∫ Φ_a(f)² dμ_{GFF} = ⟨f, G_a f⟩_lattice` (Gaussian covariance)
3. `⟨f, G_a f⟩_lattice → ⟨f, G f⟩_continuum` as a → 0 (propagator convergence)
4. The convergent sequence is bounded. -/

/-! ## Tightness -/

/-- **Tightness of the continuum-embedded measures.**

The family `{ν_a = (ι_a)_* μ_a}_{a ∈ (0, 1]}` is tight in the space of
probability measures on `S'(ℝ^d) = Configuration (ContinuumTestFunction d)`.

Proof:
1. By Mitoma's criterion, it suffices to show that for each f ∈ S(ℝ^d),
   the real-valued measures `(ev_f)_* ν_a` are tight on ℝ.
2. By Chebyshev's inequality, tightness on ℝ follows from the uniform
   second moment bound `∫ |Φ_a(f)|² dν_a ≤ C(f)`.
3. The uniform bound is provided by `second_moment_uniform`. -/
