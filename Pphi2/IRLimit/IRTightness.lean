# IR Tightness: Prokhorov Extraction for Lt → ∞

Proves tightness of the cylinder pullback measures as Lt → ∞ and
extracts a convergent subsequence via Prokhorov's theorem.

The structure follows `AsymTorusInteractingLimit.lean` exactly:
uniform second moments → Mitoma-Chebyshev → tightness → Prokhorov.

## Main results

- `cylinderIR_tight` — the family of pulled-back measures is tight
- `cylinderIRLimit_exists` — existence of the IR limit measure

/-! ## IR Limit Existence

Given a sequence of time periods `Lt_n → ∞` and for each one an interacting
measure `μ_n` on `AsymTorusTestFunction Lt_n Ls` satisfying OS0–OS2 (from
the UV limit), the pulled-back cylinder measures are tight and have a
convergent subsequence. -/

/-- The IR limit measure on the cylinder S¹_{Ls} × ℝ exists.

Given a sequence of time periods `Lt : ℕ → ℝ` with `Lt n → ∞` and
interacting measures `μ_n` on the corresponding asymmetric tori, the
pulled-back cylinder measures `cylinderPullbackMeasure (Lt n) Ls (μ n)`
have a weakly convergent subsequence.

**Proof sketch**:
1. Uniform second moment bound (from `cylinderIR_uniform_second_moment`)
2. Mitoma-Chebyshev tightness criterion (from gaussian-field)
3. Prokhorov's theorem (Polish space + tight → subsequential limit)

The limit is a probability measure on `Configuration (CylinderTestFunction Ls)`. -/
