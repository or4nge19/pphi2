# Foundations Roadmap

This note records one avenue to turn the existing `P(Φ)₂` formalization into a more foundational library capable of hosting multiple Euclidean and Minkowski formulations, together with explicit comparison theorems between them.

The current project already proves that a constructive bosonic
scalar Euclidean field theory in the Glimm-Jaffe/Nelson framework, realized as
a positive probability measure on `S'(ℝ²)` satisfying OS0-OS4.

Some distinctions that would help to make the project more foundational:

- A positive-measure Euclidean model is not the same thing as a general QFT.
- The original Osterwalder-Schrader axioms are stated for Schwinger functions,
  not directly for probability measures.
- The Euclidean-to-Minkowski passage is not automatic from bare Schwinger data:
  the original OS reconstruction needs extra growth hypotheses such as the 1975
  linear-growth conditions `E0'` / `E0''`.
- Gauge, topological, finite-density, and fermionic settings may fail to admit a
  positive-measure formulation even when they still have meaningful Euclidean or
  Minkowski correlation data.

## Formulation layers

The repository may benefit frim separating four layers of Euclidean QFT data.

1. `MeasureModel`
   A concrete positive probability measure on a configuration space, with
   generating functionals obtained by integration. This is the natural layer for
   Glimm-Jaffe/Nelson `P(Φ)₂`.

2. `TensorSchwingerModel`
   Moments or Schwinger functions on simple tensors `f₁ ⊗ ... ⊗ fₙ`, encoded as
   tuples of one-point test functions. This is weaker than a full OS Schwinger
   theory and should not be silently identified with it.

3. `DistributionalSchwingerModel`
   Genuine `n`-point Schwinger functions on an `n`-point test-function space.
   This is the level closest to the original OS axioms. Unlike the measure and
   simple-tensor layers, this requires explicit linear/topological test-function
   structure; the shared library should therefore use a stronger
   `SchwingerFormulation` interface here rather than overloading the bare
   one-point `Formulation`.

4. `ReconstructionInput`
   Extra hypotheses needed to run reconstruction, such as linear-growth
   conditions. This layer is where the hard Euclidean-to-Minkowski subtlety
   lives and should remain explicit. The hypothesis should appear as a named
   predicate on the Schwinger package, not as an anonymous bare `Prop`.

These layers are now tentatively sketched in
`Common/QFT/Euclidean/Formulations.lean`, with the backend-independent
linear-growth / reconstruction-rule surfaces factored separately into
`Common/QFT/Euclidean/ReconstructionInterfaces.lean`.

## Initial suggested refactor program

1. Extract shared formulation interfaces from `Phi4/OSAxioms.lean` into
   `Common/QFT`.
   `Phi4` already contains a more abstract Schwinger/OS interface than `Pphi2`.
   That abstraction should become shared infrastructure instead of staying
   project-local.
   Current state: `Phi4/FormulationAdapter.lean` now exposes the tensor-Schwinger
   layer using only the infinite-volume infrastructure that already builds in
   this repo. The stronger distributional-Schwinger / reconstruction adapter is
   kept in-tree but outside the active `Phi4.lean` umbrella until an external
   `OSReconstruction` backend is intentionally wired in and version-aligned.

2. Recast `Pphi2/OSAxioms.lean` as a measure-level adapter.
   `Pphi2` should remain the canonical example of a strong positive-measure
   construction, but it should export its results into the shared Schwinger /
   reconstruction interfaces instead of defining "the" OS framework by itself.
   In particular, do not add a generic `PairingMeasureModel -> TensorSchwinger`
   constructor without explicit measurability / moment-integrability input:
   that bridge is mathematically nontrivial even in scalar theories.

3. Compare theories at the Schwinger level first, not the measure level first.
   Literal equality of probability measures is a very strong notion of
   equivalence specialized to scalar positive-measure theories. The primary
   comparison object should be Schwinger data, with measure equality as a
   downstream corollary under determinacy hypotheses.

4. Formalize the reconstruction hypotheses explicitly.
   A gold-standard library should not state "OS implies Wightman" without also
   recording which extra hypothesis is actually being used in a given theorem:
   original OS 1975 growth input, a later equivalent condition, or a stronger
   project-specific replacement.

5. Keep positivity notions separate.
   Probability-measure positivity, reflection positivity, and Hilbert-space
   positivity after reconstruction are related, but they are not the same
   mathematical object. Separating them is essential for any later gauge or
   fermionic extension.

## Knowledge-advancing milestones

The following milestones would make the project more meaningful even to experts
skeptical of "formalized QFT" as a slogan.

- Prove `MeasureModel -> TensorSchwingerModel -> DistributionalSchwingerModel`
  for the current scalar theories, rather than leaving these identifications
  informal.
- Isolate the exact reconstruction input used in each route (torus, cylinder,
  plane), especially where analyticity or linear-growth bounds enter.
- Document explicitly which physically interesting settings fail at the
  `MeasureModel` layer but may still fit the later layers.
- Use a non-measure-first benchmark after `P(Φ)₂`, rather than jumping directly
  to Yang-Mills rhetoric. Good candidates include free fermionic or
  gauge-invariant observable interfaces, and eventually the `O(3)` sigma model
  as a formulation stress test.
- Keep a separate research branch for enlarged test-function frameworks
  (hyperfunctions or related variants) if they clarify reconstruction, but do
  not make them part of the core until the comparison maps are understood.
